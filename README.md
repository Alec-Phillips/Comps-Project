# Project Overview

### Motivation:

Software testing is an important skill whether you are working on a personal or industry level project. My goal with this application is to provide a resource that provides information as well as practice with the basics of software testing. It is intended for introductory to intermediate computer science students who have no prior knowledge of software testing, however more advanced students may still benefit from the content.
